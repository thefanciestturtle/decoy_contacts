# The tests create and delete contacts in the device's real address book, so
# this script refuses to run on anything but an emulator. The tests need an
# empty address book and stop if it isn't; --wipe-contacts empties it first
# (all contacts and the call log on the emulator are lost). Pick the emulator
# with ANDROID_SERIAL if more than one device is connected.
#
# Permission: the app is installed and granted the contacts permission with
# `pm grant` before the tests run, so nobody has to tap the system dialog.
# `flutter test` then reinstalls the app with `adb install -r`, which keeps
# runtime permissions that were already granted.
